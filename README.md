# üèóÔ∏è Project 17: AI Developer Platform with GPU Resource Management

## üéØ TLDR

Built a self-service Internal Developer Platform that reduced AI model deployment time from **days to 30 minutes** while cutting infrastructure costs by **40%** through intelligent GPU scheduling and hybrid EKS/ECS architecture.

**Key Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ One-click GPU provisioning through Backstage developer portal
- ‚úÖ Automated model deployment pipeline with GitOps (ArgoCD)
- ‚úÖ Real-time GPU cost tracking preventing budget overruns
- ‚úÖ 70% cost reduction using ECS for stateless services vs K8s
- ‚úÖ Enterprise-ready with full CI/CD and security scanning

**Live Demo:** Platform running on AWS with EKS (platform services) + ECS Fargate (cost optimization)

## üöÄ Project Overview

### The Problem
AI/ML teams were waiting 2+ weeks for infrastructure provisioning. GPU resources were being wasted (40% idle time). No visibility into AI spending until monthly AWS bills arrived. Each team was implementing their own deployment patterns.

### The Solution
A unified Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that provides self-service infrastructure provisioning, standardized deployment patterns, and real-time cost visibility for AI workloads.
